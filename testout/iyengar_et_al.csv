These preferences are often thought to parallel other examples of partisan homophily in social relations (e.g., Alford et al. 2011; Huber and Malhotra 2012 and partisan affect (Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes, 2012).
Alternatively, partisans may be responding reflexively and negatively to the opposite-party label in the partisan-treatment condition (Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes, 2012).",OK
,,,,,,testdata\9.pdf,"In the case of partisanship, this divergence in affect toward the in and out parties—affective polarization—has increased substantially over the past four decades (Haidt and Hetherington 2012; Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).
A standard measure of social distance—parents' displeasure over the prospects of their offspring marrying into a family with a different party affiliation—shows startling increases in the United States, but not in Britain (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).
More than fifty years after the publication of The American Voter, debates over the na- ture of partisanship and the extent of party polarization continue (see Fiorina & Abrams, 2008; Hetherington, 2009).1 While early studies viewed partisanship as a manifestation of other group affiliations (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Campbell et al. 1960), more recent work suggests that party is an important form of social identity in its own right (Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2004; Greene 1999; Huddy, Mason, and Aarøe 2010; Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).
Study 1: Anchoring Partisan Affect The growth of explicit partisan affective polarization is clear from analysis of survey data (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012), but these data only show that people report affective biases when evaluating partisan groups.
Study 4: Separating In-Group Favoritism from Out- Group Animosity Affect toward co-partisans has remained relatively stable in ANES data, while affect toward opposing partisans has dramatically decreased (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).
While Republicans view fellow partisans as patriotic, well-informed, and altruistic, Democrats are judged to exhibit precisely the opposite traits (see Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).
The permanent state of modern political campaigns (Ornstein and Mann 2000) and the persistence of partisan bias over time (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012) suggests that proximity to the campaign is a valid but likely insignificant concern.
In the contemporary American political environment, there is evidence of increasing hostility across party lines, which has been attributed to a variety of factors including can- didates' reliance on negative campaigning and the availability of news sources with a clear partisan preference (see Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Lelkes and Iyengar 2012).
Among Americans who say they identify with a political party, negative views of the out party and its supporters have risen sharply since the 1980s (Haidt and Hetherington 2012; Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012).",OK

Such an expansion is especially important given Iyengar and colleagues' (2012) observation that affective polarization is more prevalent in the U.S. today than in Britain, and that the phenomenon is most evident in the distinctly American ""battleground states.""
Social distance was operationalized in two ways, in keeping with Iyengar et al. (2012).
This study follows path- breaking work by Iyengar and colleagues (2012) that established the existence of affective polarization.
Affective polarization, as operationalized by Iyengar et al. (2012), has at least two dimensions: favorability and social distance.
Keywords: selective approach, selective avoidance, affect, polarization, comparative study PARTISAN MEDIA EXPOSURE AND AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION Implications of Pro- and Counter-Attitudinal Information Exposure for Affective Polarization Over the last several decades, Americans' attitudes toward members of an opposed political party have shifted from mild negativity to outright hostility, while attitudes toward their preferred party have remained relatively stable (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012).
Tajfel & Turner, 1979), appears to be more robust than for polarization grounded in citizens' issue positions or policy preferences (Iyengar et al., 2012).
Building on the social identity theory-based account of affective polarization presented by Iyengar et al. (2012), it is likely that selective exposure, much like campaign advertising, activates partisan identities.
Longitudinal analysis by Iyengar et al. (2012) shows growing displeasure among U.S. partisans over the possibility of children's out-party marriage.
Affective polarization in the U.S. stands in contrast to other countries such as the U.K., which have not seen comparable changes in attitudes toward oppositional parties (Iyengar et al., 2012).
The latter explicitly taps a concept that Iyengar and colleagues (2012) identify as crucial by asking respondents to assess ""individuals who support"" the Republican or Democratic Party.
Following Iyengar et al. (2012), U.S. affective polarization was measured both using favorability ratings of in- and out-party candidates and partisans, and using assessments of social distance from the opposed party.
This is despite the distinct political and media systems in the two countries, and some indications that increased affective polarization at the society level may be specific to recent U.S. history (Iyengar et al., 2012).
A further benefit of this approach is that it increases comparability with Iyengar and colleagues (2012), which also utilizes difference scores.",OK
